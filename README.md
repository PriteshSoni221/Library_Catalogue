# Library_Catalogue

A simple library catalogue with a few functions.
The program was inspired from the video "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul0sdBqrivw". Although, I have made a few changes. I added LocalDate library and used some real dates rather than numerical dates (0,1,2,..) like shown in the video.
In the future, I might add more functionalities so that we can access all the stuff and add books from user input rather than making any changes in the main method.
